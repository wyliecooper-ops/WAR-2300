# WAR-2300
This is a Open-Source RPG I am making, it is right now it ASCII art but will be made more into OG wasteland (one from the dos) it wont be perfect for a while so if you run into any bugs, please tell so I can fix them. This whole game is technaliy me marketing my Novels by putting you in the world of it. Hope you enjoy.

# Gameplay
Move with W/A/S/D (I hope I don't need to tell you want they do)
The Game is based on old school wasteland mixed with surival elements. Remeber to eat, drink and touch grass
Combat is indeed turn based.

# Current status
It is a WIP
As said above ASCII graphcs 
Tileset is planned
THERE WILL BE BUGS. REPORT THEM PLEASE

# Modding/ adding tilsets
Since it is open source so TCS are allowed and I will enjoy seeing them if any are made
All code is in there respected folder. Ex Maps-map.py (yes the game is made using python.)
tilesets can be added in the tileset folder is a little differnt as you add it like-
ex   TILES = {
       "wall": "#",
       "floor": ".",
       "player": "@",
       "enemy": "E",
       "key": "K"
     }
just replace the ASCII art to whatever set you want. (that is just a example, there will be more tiles.)

# Some context of the world
This takes place during 2300, 200 years after Dr. Yellow took the country into a Owerllian State. In the world you play as subject 232, a super solider given something called the muman virus to help. Now the Black Cross (Dr. Yellows faction) as lost the south and parts of nevada to the UNA and the deathshadow. Your goal will be expained in game but this is a post-war game. Thats the only lore drop I'll give

# How to install

You will need python3 to run it. I will expain this further once i get the files done
